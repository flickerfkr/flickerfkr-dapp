# Security Overview

This project has implemented several security measures to ensure safe user interaction:

- ✅ HTTPS (SSL certificate) is valid and enforced site-wide
- ✅ WHOIS privacy has been removed for domain ownership transparency
- ✅ Basic HTTP security headers will be implemented or scheduled
- ✅ Public documentation is maintained

No private keys or seed phrases are ever collected by the DApp.
